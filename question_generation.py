#text=Forrest Gump is a 1994 American comedy-drama film directed by Robert Zemeckis and written by Eric Roth. It is based on the 1986 novel of the same name by Winston Groom and stars Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise,  Mykelti Williamson and Sally Field. The story depicts several decades in the life of Forrest Gump (Hanks),  a slow-witted but kind-hearted man from Alabama who witnesses and unwittingly influences several defining  historical events in the 20th century United States. The film differs substantially from the novel.
